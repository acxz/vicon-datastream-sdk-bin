# Vicon Datastream SDK (bin)

This repository is a Linux64 binary only mirror of [Vicon's Datastream SDK](https://www.vicon.com/software/datastream-sdk/).

Vicon's Datastream SDK has been available under an MIT License since 1.8.0 and
as such this repo serves to track the SDK as a git mirror for easier version
controlled integration into downstream projects instead of having to procure the
SDK manually. This repo only tracks the headers and libraries distributed by the
Vicon Datastream SDK, for a source based installation see @whoenig's
[vicon-datastream-sdk](https://github.com/whoenig/vicon-datastream-sdk).
